For the second project of the course INE 5408, my teacher asked us to make a search system capable to find
primary keys and secondary keys on the manpages of the Unix system. The first objective was to do all the 
work on secondary memory (Hard Disk). Unfortunately, me and my partner, Otto Pires, cannot get finish on time
and the program still "Seg Fault". We are too lazy to fix it up on our holiday, so feel free to help us :D.
