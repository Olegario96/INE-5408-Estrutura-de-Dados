For the first projetct of the course INE 5408, my teacher asked us to code a traffic  simulator. Unfortunately,
my teacher did not code a test, since many interpretations could be done. The most part of documentation is fine, but 
parts are still not much clear. Any questions, talk with me, I will be happy to help. OBS.: The program has no graphic
interface.
